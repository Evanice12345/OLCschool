      <p id="SC_p"> My first year at the OLC school, as a 6th grader, I had applied for the role of secretary in the
        student council.
        It was my first year in OLC and I thought it was a great oppurtinity. I had 2 opponents.
        I had to create a speech and a few posters for people to vote for me.
        My speech wasn't the greatest as I didn't really have an idea of what I was supposed to write.
        It was fun hearing everyone else's speeches and making new friends. Although I didn't get to be the secretary, I
        still had a fun time.
        <br>
        <br>
        My second year at OLC school, as a 7th grader, I applied for the student council again. This time as treasurer.
        I had plenty of opponents.
        I was confident of my speech, but unfortunatly I didn't make it to the position. But remember what they say, "As
        long as you try your best, you are never a failure."
        It's nervewracking saying a speech infront of many students, but it helps you practice for the real world. It
        was exciting hearing each candidate's
        well prepared speeches.

        Oh dear! Where do I start? When there is a fun day in OLC, it is absolutly fun! Before Thankgiving, Winter, and
        Spring breaks,
        everyone has the most fun! We all do fun activities and games. We sometimes even watch movies!! Whenever there
        is half day before break,
        or dress down day on a friday, I promise you we enjoy! There are also Field days, where we get to go
        to the lower school field and play for 1 hour with our friends. It happens twice a year and is extremely fun!
        Away from school work for a
        while!

      <p id="SC_p">
        Now let me begin with the work. We usually get projects to work on during the middle/end of the year. They're
        worth about 25% of our
        grade and help improve our critical thinking. In sixth grade, I was assigned a project that included lots of
        research. Our teachers teach us
        lots of tactics and tricks to help us in our project. We get projects based on what we're learning. To conclude
        the lesson. There are sometimes group projects,
        which help us in social interaction. Overall, it's entertaining to watch other people's projects and hear
        people's opinions on yours. When doing projects,
        you learn a lot about your subject and it improves your critical thinking.
